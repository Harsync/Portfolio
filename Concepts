Here are a list of the concepts I related to the most this term. 

1. That Things Break
- One of the first concepts we were introduced to was that not everything can work out perfectly, that things break.
I expirence this with almost every module this term: whenever my model would break or I couldnt figure somethings out, I learned to find
a way around it or try something new to breed new results. In the end I am happy with my work and think I've provided an awesome
model. 
2. Remixing History
 - The theme of remixing history was a big one after module 1 where we were assignment a project of combining our real-world model with 
 another from history. Here we learned the importance of preserving history as well as the consequences of bringing a historical artefact
 into the digital world. Model 2 was one of my favorite modules because I was able to create a "new" model from a medallion that is close to 
 me with the Capitoline Wolf which is also shrouded with mystery. The meshing of the two models was both challenging and fun where I learned 
 how to transform certain objects and even convert my original model to be flexible in its orientation.
